# INSTRUCTION
1. Check if information is already documented elsewhere
   - Search for similar content in other README files
   - Verify if the information already exists in the project
2. If information exists elsewhere:
   - Reference the existing file in INSTRUCTION section only
   - Use instructive references like `Execute [filename]` or `See [filename]`
3. If creating new content:
   - Ensure it doesn't duplicate existing information
   - Focus on unique, context-specific instructions

# MOTIVATION
Avoid information duplication across files to maintain single source of truth and make the project easier to maintain
