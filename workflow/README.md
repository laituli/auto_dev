# Instruction
1. do `setup.md`
2. do `workspace.md`

## Motivation
1. build a meta workflow for developing to develop

## What is Meta-Development?
Meta-development means creating workflows and tools that help develop other development processes. This project provides a framework for building consistent, constraint-driven development workflows that follow good software engineering principles.

## Expected Outcomes
- Step-by-step instructive workflows that are easy to follow
- Separation of concerns between setup, workspace management, and modification tasks
- Constraint-driven development ensuring quality and consistency
- Self-referential system where the meta-development process improves itself
