# INSTRUCTION
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Understand why explanations were needed
   - Document the specific workflow gaps or misunderstandings that prompted user intervention
   - Identify patterns in required explanations across multiple workflow executions
   - Categorize explanations by type (clarification, correction, guidance, etc.)

2. **Workflow Compliance Analysis**: Examine why current workflow required explanations
   - Analyze where the workflow deviated from expected behavior
   - Identify steps that consistently require manual intervention
   - Document gaps between workflow design and actual execution requirements

3. **Preventive Design**: Identify what better workflow avoids explanations
   - Design workflow improvements that eliminate the need for explanations
   - Create self-explanatory steps that anticipate user needs
   - Implement validation and error handling to prevent misunderstandings

4. **Issue Maintenance**: Document issues following project practices
   - Ensure all identified issues are properly documented in the issues/ folder
   - Follow consistent formatting and structure for issue documentation
   - Include specific examples and context for each identified problem

5. **Optional Future Visibility**: Only if specified by user
   - [Optional] Implement mechanisms to ensure unresolved issues remain visible
   - [Optional] Set up tracking for issues that require future workflow attention
   - [Optional] Create reminders for recurring patterns that need addressing

# MOTIVATION
The analysis phase exists because workflows often fail and require manual fixes and explanations. By systematically analyzing why explanations are needed and designing workflows that prevent them, we create a self-improving meta-development system. This transforms reactive manual interventions into proactive workflow improvements, reducing the need for explanations over time.

# ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES
- **Quantifiable Focus**: Track the amount and types of manual fixes and explanations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring explanation patterns across workflow executions
- **Preventive Design**: Focus on creating workflows that are self-explanatory
- **Actionable Improvements**: Ensure analysis leads to concrete workflow enhancements
- **User-Centered**: Base improvements on actual user intervention patterns
