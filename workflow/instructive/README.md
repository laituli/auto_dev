# Instruction
1. check every file contains `INSTRUCTION` section.
2. check `INSTRUCTION` is step by step instructive.

# Motivation
1. we must ensure that constraints are included by work and not by talk.
2. files generated by meta workflow might not be read later
3. follow the a same principle everywhere, similar to functional programming.
